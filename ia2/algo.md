An AVL tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree (BST) where the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees (known as the balance factor) for any node cannot exceed one. This property ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced, leading to efficient operations such as insertion, deletion, and lookup. The AVL tree was introduced by Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis in 1962.

## Characteristics of AVL Trees

1. **Balance Factor**: The balance factor for a node is calculated as:
   $$
   \text{Balance Factor} = \text{Height of Left Subtree} - \text{Height of Right Subtree}
   $$
   The balance factor must be one of $$-1$$, $$0$$, or $$1$$ for the tree to remain balanced.

2. **Height**: The height of an AVL tree with $$n$$ nodes is guaranteed to be $$O(\log n)$$, which allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Rotations in AVL Trees

To maintain balance after insertions or deletions, AVL trees utilize rotations. There are four types of rotations:

### 1. LL Rotation (Left-Left)
This rotation is applied when a node is added to the left subtree of the left child, causing the tree to become unbalanced to the left. 

**Example**:
```
      30
     /
   20
  /
10
```
After inserting 10, a right rotation around 30 is performed.

### 2. RR Rotation (Right-Right)
This rotation is used when a node is added to the right subtree of the right child, causing the tree to become unbalanced to the right.

**Example**:
```
10
  \
   20
     \
      30
```
After inserting 30, a left rotation around 10 is performed.

### 3. LR Rotation (Left-Right)
This is a combination of a left rotation followed by a right rotation. It is applied when a node is added to the right subtree of the left child.

**Example**:
```
      30
     /
   10
     \
      20
```
After inserting 20, a left rotation on 10 followed by a right rotation on 30 is performed.

### 4. RL Rotation (Right-Left)
This is a combination of a right rotation followed by a left rotation. It is used when a node is added to the left subtree of the right child.

**Example**:
```
10
  \
   30
  /
20
```
After inserting 20, a right rotation on 30 followed by a left rotation on 10 is performed.

## Applications of AVL Trees

AVL trees are particularly useful in scenarios where frequent lookups are required, such as:

- Database indexing systems where insertions and deletions are less frequent compared to searches.
- Memory management systems where maintaining sorted data is crucial.

## Conclusion

AVL trees are an essential data structure in computer science, providing a robust solution for maintaining sorted data with efficient operations. Their self-balancing nature ensures that the tree remains balanced after operations, leading to optimal performance in various applications. The four types of rotations allow AVL trees to maintain this balance effectively, making them a preferred choice for many applications requiring dynamic data management.

Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements. It operates in two main phases: building a max heap from the input data and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap to produce a sorted array. Let's walk through the heapsort process step-by-step using the provided array: **10, 28, 60, 5, 30, 17, 44**.

## Step 1: Build a Max Heap

### Initial Array
The initial array is:
```
[10, 28, 60, 5, 30, 17, 44]
```

### Building the Max Heap
To build a max heap, we start from the last non-leaf node and heapify each node up to the root. The last non-leaf node can be found at index `(n/2) - 1`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

1. **Heapify at index 2** (value 60):
   - Left child (index 5, value 17) and right child (index 6, value 44).
   - Since 60 is greater than both children, no changes are needed.

2. **Heapify at index 1** (value 28):
   - Left child (index 3, value 5) and right child (index 4, value 30).
   - The largest value among 28, 5, and 30 is 30 (at index 4).
   - Swap 28 and 30.
   - The array becomes: `[10, 30, 60, 5, 28, 17, 44]`.

3. **Heapify at index 0** (value 10):
   - Left child (index 1, value 30) and right child (index 2, value 60).
   - The largest value among 10, 30, and 60 is 60 (at index 2).
   - Swap 10 and 60.
   - The array becomes: `[60, 30, 10, 5, 28, 17, 44]`.
   - Now heapify at index 2 (value 10):
     - Left child (index 5, value 17) and right child (index 6, value 44).
     - The largest value is 44 (at index 6).
     - Swap 10 and 44.
     - The array becomes: `[60, 30, 44, 5, 28, 17, 10]`.

### Max Heap Result
The max heap built from the array is:
```
[60, 30, 44, 5, 28, 17, 10]
```

## Step 2: Sorting the Array

Now we will sort the array by repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap and placing it at the end of the array.

1. **Extract Maximum (60)**:
   - Swap 60 with the last element (10).
   - The array becomes: `[10, 30, 44, 5, 28, 17, 60]`.
   - Reduce the heap size by 1 (ignore the last element).
   - Heapify the root (index 0):
     - Left child (index 1, value 30) and right child (index 2, value 44).
     - The largest is 44 (index 2).
     - Swap 10 and 44.
     - The array becomes: `[44, 30, 10, 5, 28, 17, 60]`.
     - Heapify at index 2 (value 10):
       - Left child (index 5, value 17) has the largest value.
       - Swap 10 and 17.
       - The array becomes: `[44, 30, 17, 5, 28, 10, 60]`.

2. **Extract Maximum (44)**:
   - Swap 44 with 10.
   - The array becomes: `[10, 30, 17, 5, 28, 44, 60]`.
   - Heapify the root:
     - Left child (index 1, value 30) and right child (index 2, value 17).
     - The largest is 30.
     - Swap 10 and 30.
     - The array becomes: `[30, 10, 17, 5, 28, 44, 60]`.
     - Heapify at index 1 (value 10):
       - Left child (index 3, value 5) and right child (index 4, value 28).
       - The largest is 28.
       - Swap 10 and 28.
       - The array becomes: `[30, 28, 17, 5, 10, 44, 60]`.

3. **Extract Maximum (30)**:
   - Swap 30 with 10.
   - The array becomes: `[10, 28, 17, 5, 30, 44, 60]`.
   - Heapify the root:
     - Left child (index 1, value 28) and right child (index 2, value 17).
     - The largest is 28.
     - Swap 10 and 28.
     - The array becomes: `[28, 10, 17, 5, 30, 44, 60]`.
     - Heapify at index 1 (value 10):
       - Left child (index 3, value 5) has no larger children.
       - No changes needed.

4. **Extract Maximum (28)**:
   - Swap 28 with 5.
   - The array becomes: `[5, 10, 17, 28, 30, 44, 60]`.
   - Heapify the root:
     - Left child (index 1, value 10) and right child (index 2, value 17).
     - The largest is 17.
     - Swap 5 and 17.
     - The array becomes: `[17, 10, 5, 28, 30, 44, 60]`.

5. **Extract Maximum (17)**:
   - Swap 17 with 5.
   - The array becomes: `[5, 10, 17, 28, 30, 44, 60]`.
   - Heapify the root:
     - Left child (index 1, value 10) has no larger children.
     - No changes needed.

6. **Extract Maximum (10)**:
   - Swap 10 with 5.
   - The array becomes: `[5, 10, 17, 28, 30, 44, 60]`.
   - Heapify the root:
     - No children to compare.
     - No changes needed.

7. **Extract Maximum (5)**:
   - The last remaining element is 5.
   - The array is now sorted.

## Final Sorted Array
The sorted array is:
```
[5, 10, 17, 28, 30, 44, 60]
```

## Conclusion
Heapsort efficiently sorts the array **10, 28, 60, 5, 30, 17, 44** into **[5, 10, 17, 28, 30, 44, 60]** using the properties of a max heap. The algorithm operates in **O(n log n)** time complexity for both average and worst cases, making it a reliable choice for sorting tasks.


Counting sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that is efficient for sorting integers when the range of the input values is known and not significantly larger than the number of elements to be sorted. However, since you mentioned "comparison counting," it seems you might be referring to a method that counts comparisons made during sorting, such as during a comparison-based sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort. 

For this explanation, I will demonstrate how to sort the array **[62, 31, 84, 96, 19, 47]** using the **Merge Sort** algorithm, which is a classic comparison-based sorting technique. I will also include the counting of comparisons made during the sorting process.

## Step 1: Understanding Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works as follows:

1. **Divide**: Split the array into two halves.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort both halves.
3. **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves to produce the sorted array.

### Key Properties of Merge Sort
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) in the average and worst cases.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the temporary arrays used for merging.
- **Stability**: Merge sort is stable, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements.

## Step 2: Sorting the Array

### Initial Array
The initial array is:
```
[62, 31, 84, 96, 19, 47]
```

### Sorting Process

1. **Divide the Array**:
   - Split into two halves:
     - Left: `[62, 31, 84]`
     - Right: `[96, 19, 47]`

2. **Sort the Left Half** `[62, 31, 84]`:
   - Split into:
     - Left: ``
     - Right: `[31, 84]`
   - The left half `` is already sorted.
   - Sort the right half `[31, 84]`:
     - Split into:
       - Left: ``
       - Right: ``
     - Both `` and `` are sorted.
   - Merge `` and ``:
     - Comparisons: 1 (31 < 84)
     - Result: `[31, 84]`
   - Now merge `` and `[31, 84]`:
     - Comparisons: 2 (62 > 31 and then 62 > 84)
     - Result: `[31, 62, 84]`

3. **Sort the Right Half** `[96, 19, 47]`:
   - Split into:
     - Left: ``
     - Right: `[19, 47]`
   - The left half `` is already sorted.
   - Sort the right half `[19, 47]`:
     - Split into:
       - Left: ``
       - Right: ``
     - Both `` and `` are sorted.
   - Merge `` and ``:
     - Comparisons: 1 (19 < 47)
     - Result: `[19, 47]`
   - Now merge `` and `[19, 47]`:
     - Comparisons: 2 (96 > 19 and then 96 > 47)
     - Result: `[19, 47, 96]`

4. **Final Merge**:
   - Now merge the two sorted halves `[31, 62, 84]` and `[19, 47, 96]`:
   - Compare elements:
     - Compare 31 and 19: 1 comparison (31 > 19)
     - Compare 31 and 47: 2 comparisons (31 < 47)
     - Compare 62 and 47: 3 comparisons (62 > 47)
     - Compare 62 and 96: 4 comparisons (62 < 96)
     - Compare 84 and 96: 5 comparisons (84 < 96)
   - Result: `[19, 31, 47, 62, 84, 96]`

### Total Comparisons
- Left Half: 3 comparisons
- Right Half: 3 comparisons
- Final Merge: 5 comparisons
- **Total Comparisons**: 11 comparisons

## Final Sorted Array
The sorted array is:
```
[19, 31, 47, 62, 84, 96]
```

## Conclusion
Using the Merge Sort algorithm, we successfully sorted the array **[62, 31, 84, 96, 19, 47]** into **[19, 31, 47, 62, 84, 96]** while counting the total number of comparisons made during the sorting process, which amounted to **11 comparisons**. Merge Sort's efficiency and stability make it a valuable algorithm in various applications, especially when working with large datasets.



A binary tree is a fundamental data structure in computer science that is widely used for efficient storage and retrieval of data. It is a hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Definition and Properties

A binary tree can be recursively defined as a collection of nodes where each node contains a value and references to at most two other nodes (the left child and the right child). The topmost node is called the root, and the nodes without any children are called leaf nodes.

Some key properties of binary trees include:

- The maximum number of nodes at level $$i$$ is $$2^{i-1}$$.
- A binary tree with $$n$$ nodes always has $$n-1$$ edges.
- The minimum possible height of a binary tree with $$n$$ nodes is $$\lfloor \log_2(n+1) \rfloor$$.
- The maximum possible height of a binary tree with $$n$$ nodes is $$n-1$$.

## Types of Binary Trees

There are several types of binary trees based on their properties:

1. **Full Binary Tree**: A binary tree is full if every node has either zero or two children.

2. **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary tree is complete if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.

3. **Perfect Binary Tree**: A binary tree is perfect if all internal nodes have two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

4. **Balanced Binary Tree**: A binary tree is balanced if the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. Examples include AVL trees and Red-Black trees.

5. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary search tree is a binary tree where for each node, the value of all nodes in its left subtree is less than the node's value, and the value of all nodes in its right subtree is greater than the node's value.

## Applications and Operations

Binary trees have numerous applications in computer science, including:

- Expression evaluation and parsing
- Efficient searching and sorting (e.g., binary search)
- Implementing file systems and directories
- Decision-making processes (e.g., game trees, decision trees)
- Storing hierarchical data (e.g., family trees, organization charts)

Common operations performed on binary trees include:

- Traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order)
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Searching
- Finding the minimum or maximum value

The time complexity of these operations depends on the type of binary tree and its properties. For example, in a balanced binary search tree, the average time complexity for searching, insertion, and deletion is $$O(\log n)$$.

## Conclusion

Binary trees are a fundamental and versatile data structure in computer science, providing efficient storage and retrieval of data. Their hierarchical structure and various types make them suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple data storage to complex decision-making processes. Understanding binary trees and their properties is crucial for designing and analyzing efficient algorithms.

A **2-3 tree** is a type of balanced search tree that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. It is a type of B-tree where each node can contain either one or two keys and can have two or three children, respectively. This structure ensures that the tree remains balanced, meaning that all leaf nodes are at the same depth.

## Properties of 2-3 Trees

1. **Node Structure**:
   - A 2-node contains one key and has two children.
   - A 3-node contains two keys and has three children.

2. **Ordering**:
   - In a 2-node, the left child contains values less than the key, and the right child contains values greater than the key.
   - In a 3-node, the left child contains values less than the first key, the middle child contains values between the two keys, and the right child contains values greater than the second key.

3. **Balanced**: All leaf nodes are at the same level, which guarantees that operations such as search, insertion, and deletion can be performed in O(log n) time.

## Insertion into a 2-3 Tree

When inserting a new value into a 2-3 tree, the following steps are followed:

1. Start at the root and find the appropriate leaf node where the new key should be inserted.
2. If the node is a 2-node, simply insert the new key and sort the keys.
3. If the node is a 3-node, split the node into two 2-nodes and promote the middle key to the parent node. If the parent is also a 3-node, this process may propagate up the tree.

## Example: Inserting (9, 5, 8, 32, 4, 7)

Let's go through the insertion of the values **9, 5, 8, 32, 4, 7** step by step.

### Step 1: Insert 9
- The tree is empty initially. We create a 2-node with the value **9**.

```
[9]
```

### Step 2: Insert 5
- Insert **5** into the tree. Since there is only one key, we can insert it and sort the keys.

```
[5, 9]
```

### Step 3: Insert 8
- Insert **8**. The node is now a 3-node with keys **5** and **9**.

```
[5, 8, 9]
```

### Step 4: Insert 32
- Inserting **32** will cause the node to split because it can only hold two keys. We split the node into two 2-nodes and promote **8** to the root.

```
      [8]
     /   \
 [5]     [9, 32]
```

### Step 5: Insert 4
- Insert **4** into the left child (which is a 2-node). Since **4 < 5**, it will be added to the left.

```
      [8]
     /   \
 [4, 5]  [9, 32]
```

### Step 6: Insert 7
- Insert **7** into the left child. This node is a 2-node, so we can insert and sort the keys.

```
      [8]
     /   \
 [4, 5, 7] [9, 32]
```

- Now, the left child has three keys, which requires splitting. We split it into two 2-nodes and promote **5** to the root.

```
       [5, 8]
      /   |   \
   [4]   [7]  [9, 32]
```

### Final Structure
After inserting all the values, the final 2-3 tree is:

```
       [5, 8]
      /   |   \
   [4]   [7]  [9, 32]
```

## Conclusion

A 2-3 tree is an efficient and balanced search tree that maintains sorted data. By allowing nodes to have two or three children, it ensures that all leaf nodes remain at the same depth, resulting in efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. In our example, we successfully inserted the values **9, 5, 8, 32, 4, 7** into a 2-3 tree, demonstrating how the tree maintains balance through splits and promotions. Understanding 2-3 trees is essential for grasping more complex data structures like B-trees, which are widely used in databases and file systems.


Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that utilizes a binary heap data structure to sort elements. It operates by first building a heap from the input data and then repeatedly extracting the maximum (or minimum) element from the heap to produce a sorted array. Heapsort is known for its efficiency, operating in $$O(n \log n)$$ time complexity for both average and worst-case scenarios.

## Bottom-Up Heapsort

The bottom-up approach to heapsort involves building the heap starting from the bottom of the tree and moving upwards. This method is efficient because it minimizes the number of comparisons needed to maintain the heap property.

### Steps in Bottom-Up Heapsort

1. **Build a Heap**: Start with an unsorted array and transform it into a heap. This is done by calling the `heapify` function on each non-leaf node, starting from the last non-leaf node and moving upwards to the root.
  
2. **Sort the Array**: Once the heap is built, repeatedly extract the maximum element (for a max-heap) and place it at the end of the array, reducing the size of the heap by one each time. After each extraction, call the `heapify` function to maintain the heap property.

### Example: Sorting the Array [10, 28, 60, 5, 30, 17, 44]

Let's walk through the bottom-up heapsort algorithm using the array **[10, 28, 60, 5, 30, 17, 44]**.

#### Step 1: Build the Heap

1. **Initial Array**:
   ```
   [10, 28, 60, 5, 30, 17, 44]
   ```

2. **Heapify Process**:
   - Start from the last non-leaf node. The last non-leaf node can be found at index $$\lfloor n/2 \rfloor - 1$$. For our array of size 7, this is index 2 (value 60).
   
   - **Heapify at index 2** (value 60):
     - Left child (index 5, value 17) and right child (index 6, value 44).
     - 60 is greater than both children, so no changes are needed.

   - **Heapify at index 1** (value 28):
     - Left child (index 3, value 5) and right child (index 4, value 30).
     - The largest is 30 (at index 4). Swap 28 and 30.
     ```
     [10, 30, 60, 5, 28, 17, 44]
     ```

   - **Heapify at index 4** (value 28):
     - This is a leaf node, so no changes are needed.

   - **Heapify at index 0** (value 10):
     - Left child (index 1, value 30) and right child (index 2, value 60).
     - The largest is 60 (at index 2). Swap 10 and 60.
     ```
     [60, 30, 10, 5, 28, 17, 44]
     ```
     - Now heapify at index 2 (value 10):
       - Left child (index 5, value 17) and right child (index 6, value 44).
       - The largest is 44 (at index 6). Swap 10 and 44.
       ```
       [60, 30, 44, 5, 28, 17, 10]
       ```

3. **Final Heap Structure**:
   ```
   [60, 30, 44, 5, 28, 17, 10]
   ```

#### Step 2: Sort the Array

Now that we have built the max heap, we will sort the array by repeatedly extracting the maximum element.

1. **Extract Maximum (60)**:
   - Swap 60 with the last element (10).
   ```
   [10, 30, 44, 5, 28, 17, 60]
   ```
   - Reduce the heap size by 1 and heapify the root:
     - Heapify at index 0 (value 10):
       - Left child (index 1, value 30) and right child (index 2, value 44).
       - The largest is 44. Swap 10 and 44.
       ```
       [44, 30, 10, 5, 28, 17, 60]
       ```
       - Heapify at index 2 (value 10):
         - Left child (index 5, value 17) has no larger children.
       ```
       [44, 30, 10, 5, 28, 17, 60]
       ```

2. **Extract Maximum (44)**:
   - Swap 44 with the last element (17).
   ```
   [17, 30, 10, 5, 28, 44, 60]
   ```
   - Heapify the root:
     - Heapify at index 0 (value 17):
       - Left child (index 1, value 30) and right child (index 2, value 10).
       - The largest is 30. Swap 17 and 30.
       ```
       [30, 17, 10, 5, 28, 44, 60]

```
[5, 10, 17, 28, 30, 44, 60]
```

## Conclusion
Heapsort is an efficient sorting algorithm that utilizes a binary heap structure to sort data. The bottom-up approach is particularly effective in building the heap, as demonstrated with the example of sorting the array **[10, 28, 60, 5, 30, 17, 44]** into **[5, 10, 17, 28, 30, 44, 60]**. This method minimizes comparisons and maintains the efficiency of the heapsort algorithm, achieving a time complexity of $$O(n \log n)$$.

**Counting Sort** is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that is particularly effective for sorting integers within a known range. It works by counting the occurrences of each unique value in the input array and then using this information to determine the positions of each value in the sorted output. This method is efficient when the range of potential values (the difference between the maximum and minimum values) is not significantly larger than the number of elements to be sorted.

In this explanation, we will use **Counting Sort** to sort the array **[13, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13]**.

## Steps in Counting Sort

### Step 1: Determine the Range of Input Values

First, we need to identify the minimum and maximum values in the array to determine the range of the counting array.

- **Minimum Value**: 11
- **Maximum Value**: 13

### Step 2: Create the Counting Array

Next, we create a counting array that will hold the counts of each unique value in the input array. The size of this array will be equal to the range of the input values plus one (to include the maximum value).

- **Range**: Maximum - Minimum + 1 = 13 - 11 + 1 = 3
- **Counting Array Size**: 3

We will create a counting array where:
- Index 0 corresponds to the value 11
- Index 1 corresponds to the value 12
- Index 2 corresponds to the value 13

### Step 3: Count the Occurrences

We will iterate through the input array and count the occurrences of each value, storing these counts in the counting array.

- Initialize the counting array: 
  ```
  Count = [0, 0, 0]
  ```

- Count occurrences:
  - For 13: Count += 1 → Count = [0, 0, 1]
  - For 11: Count += 1 → Count = [1, 0, 1]
  - For 12: Count += 1 → Count = [1, 1, 1]
  - For 12: Count += 1 → Count = [1, 2, 1]
  - For 12: Count += 1 → Count = [1, 3, 1]
  - For 13: Count += 1 → Count = [1, 3, 2]

### Step 4: Compute the Cumulative Count

Next, we will compute the cumulative count, which will help us determine the positions of each value in the sorted output array.

- Update the counting array:
  - Count = Count → Count = [1, 3, 2]
  - Count = Count + Count → Count = [1, 4, 2]
  - Count = Count + Count → Count = [1, 4, 6]

### Step 5: Build the Output Array

Now, we will create the output array and place each element in its correct position based on the cumulative counts.

1. Initialize the output array:
   ```
   Output = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ```

2. Iterate through the input array in reverse order to maintain stability:
   - For 13: Place it at index Count - 1 = 1 → Output = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 13], Count = [1, 4, 1]
   - For 12: Place it at index Count - 1 = 3 → Output = [0, 0, 0, 12, 0, 13], Count = [1, 3, 1]
   - For 12: Place it at index Count - 1 = 2 → Output = [0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 13], Count = [1, 2, 1]
   - For 12: Place it at index Count - 1 = 1 → Output = [0, 12, 12, 12, 0, 13], Count = [1, 1, 1]
   - For 11: Place it at index Count - 1 = 0 → Output = [11, 12, 12, 12, 0, 13], Count = [0, 1, 1]
   - For 13: Place it at index Count - 1 = 1 → Output = [11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13], Count = [0, 1, 0]

### Final Output Array

After placing all elements, the final sorted output array is:
```
[11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13]
```

## Conclusion

Using the Counting Sort algorithm, we successfully sorted the array **[13, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13]** into **[11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13]**. This method is particularly efficient for sorting integers with a limited range of values, achieving a time complexity of **O(n + k)**, where **n** is the number of elements in the input array and **k** is the range of the input values. Counting Sort is stable and works well in scenarios where the range of input values is not significantly larger than the number of elements.


**Merge Sort** is a classic sorting algorithm that employs the divide-and-conquer strategy to sort elements efficiently. It is particularly well-suited for large datasets and is known for its stability and guaranteed time complexity of $$O(n \log n)$$ in the average and worst cases.

## How Merge Sort Works

### Key Concepts

1. **Divide**: The array is recursively divided into two halves until each subarray contains a single element (which is inherently sorted).
2. **Conquer**: The sorted subarrays are then merged back together in a sorted manner.
3. **Combine**: The merging process continues until the entire array is reassembled in sorted order.

### Properties of Merge Sort

- **Time Complexity**: $$O(n \log n)$$ for all cases (best, average, and worst).
- **Space Complexity**: $$O(n)$$ due to the temporary arrays used for merging.
- **Stability**: Merge sort is stable, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements.

## Example: Sorting the Array [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]

Let’s walk through the merge sort algorithm step-by-step using the array **[38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]**.

### Step 1: Divide the Array

1. **Initial Array**:
   ```
   [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
   ```

2. **First Split**:
   - Split into two halves:
   ```
   Left:  [38, 27, 43]
   Right: [3, 9, 82, 10]
   ```

3. **Further Splitting**:
   - Split the left half `[38, 27, 43]`:
   ```
   Left:  [38]
   Right: [27, 43]
   ```
   - Split the right half `[3, 9, 82, 10]`:
   ```
   Left:  [3, 9]
   Right: [82, 10]
   ```

4. **Continue Splitting**:
   - Split `[27, 43]` into:
   ```
   Left:  [27]
   Right: [43]
   ```
   - Split `[3, 9]` into:
   ```
   Left:  [3]
   Right: [9]
   ```
   - Split `[82, 10]` into:
   ```
   Left:  [82]
   Right: [10]
   ```

### Step 2: Merge the Subarrays

Now that we have split the array down to single elements, we will start merging them back together in sorted order.

1. **Merge  and **:
   - Compare 27 and 43. The merged result is:
   ```
   [27, 43]
   ```

2. **Merge  and **:
   - Compare 3 and 9. The merged result is:
   ```
   [3, 9]
   ```

3. **Merge  and **:
   - Compare 82 and 10. The merged result is:
   ```
   [10, 82]
   ```

4. **Merge  and [27, 43]**:
   - Compare 38 with the first element of [27, 43]:
   - 27 < 38, so we take 27 first.
   - Next, compare 38 with 43:
   - The merged result is:
   ```
   [27, 38, 43]
   ```

5. **Merge [3, 9] and [10, 82]**:
   - Compare 3 with 10:
   - The merged result is:
   ```
   [3, 9, 10, 82]
   ```

### Step 3: Final Merge

Now we will merge the two sorted halves `[27, 38, 43]` and `[3, 9, 10, 82]`.

1. **Merge [27, 38, 43] and [3, 9, 10, 82]**:
   - Compare 27 with 3:
   - 3 < 27, so we take 3 first.
   - Next, compare 27 with 9:
   - 9 < 27, so we take 9.
   - Next, compare 27 with 10:
   - 10 < 27, so we take 10.
   - Finally, take the remaining elements:
   - The merged result is:
   ```
   [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
   ```

### Final Sorted Array

The sorted array is:
```
[3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
```

## Conclusion

Merge Sort is a powerful sorting algorithm that effectively sorts data using the divide-and-conquer approach. By recursively splitting the array into smaller subarrays and merging them back together in sorted order, it achieves a consistent time complexity of $$O(n \log n)$$. This makes it suitable for sorting large datasets, especially when stability is required. Understanding Merge Sort is essential for grasping more advanced sorting techniques and algorithms in computer science.
